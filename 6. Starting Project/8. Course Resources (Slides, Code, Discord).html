<p>Great to have you on board as a student!</p><p>This course also comes with free access to our “<strong>Academind Community</strong>” on Discord: <a href="https://academind.com/community/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academind.com/community/</a></p><p>---</p><p>There, you can find <strong>more than 200.000</strong> <strong>like-minded people</strong>, <strong>discuss</strong> issues, <strong>help each other</strong>, share progress, successes and ideas and simply <strong>have a good time</strong>!</p><p>I believe that you learn the most if you <strong>don’t learn alone </strong>but find learning partners and other people with similar interests. Our community is a great place for this - it’s the perfect complimentary resource for this course.</p><p><strong>Joining it is of course free and 100% optional.</strong></p><p>---</p><p>You find course resources (code snapshots &amp;&nbsp;slides) on GitHub, in this repository: <a href="https://github.com/academind/cypress-e2e-testing-course-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/academind/cypress-e2e-testing-course-resources</a></p><p>The folders in the <code>code</code> folder map to the different course sections.</p><p>The folders inside those subfolders represent individual code snapshots - e.g., the starting project code for a course section.</p>
